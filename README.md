#Clock app 
This is my solution to the Advice Generator App from Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clock-app-LMFaxFwrM
)
In this challange I've used Random Quotes API (https://api.quotable.io/random') and information based on user IP (https://worldtimeapi.org/api/ip)



## Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View the current time and location information based on their IP address
- View additional information about the date and time in the expanded state
- Be shown the correct greeting and background image based on the time of day they're visiting the site
- Generate random programming quotes by clicking the refresh icon near the quote


## My process

In this challange I practiced how to interact with API's by using async, await and fetch methods
